The `cpp` folder contains the source code for some useful programs used by other scripts.

The `bin` folder contains the executables generated by the programs in the `cpp` folder.

The `bash_scripts` folder provides some examples of scripts using the cgroup feauture. Each example has its own readme file, explaining its goals and purpose.
